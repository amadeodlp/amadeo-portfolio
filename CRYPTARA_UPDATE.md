# Cryptara Project Update

## Changes Made

The "Finance Simplified" project has been renamed to "Cryptara" throughout the portfolio. The following changes were made:

1. **Projects.tsx:**
   - Renamed "Finance Simplified" to "Cryptara"
   - Updated the project description to reflect the new branding
   - Added the project to the top of the projects list
   - Made the project "featured" to give it more prominence
   - Added ".NET" to the technologies list
   - Updated the project image display to show the cryptara.png screenshot

2. **Images:**
   - Now using the cryptara.png image from the assets/images folder
   - Added conditional rendering in the project card so that only Cryptara shows a real image instead of the default gradient with initials

3. **GitHub Link:**
   - Kept the original GitHub repository link (`https://github.com/amadeodlp/finance-simplified`) since the repo may not have been renamed yet

## Next Steps

1. **Repository Renaming:**
   - Consider renaming the GitHub repository from "finance-simplified" to "cryptara" for brand consistency
   - If you rename the repo, update the GitHub link in Projects.tsx

2. **Image Optimization:**
   - The SVG image created is a placeholder. You may want to replace it with an actual screenshot of the Cryptara application interface
   - For best performance, consider optimizing the image or converting it to a more efficient format

3. **Build & Deploy:**
   - Remember to rebuild the project to incorporate these changes before deploying to your hosting platform

## Working with Images in Vite

I've updated the code to properly import and use the Cryptara image in a Vite React project:

1. **Direct Image Import:**
   - Added `import cryptaraImage from '@/assets/images/cryptara.png';` at the top of the file
   - Using the imported variable directly: `<img src={cryptaraImage} />` instead of a string path
   - Updated the project data to use the imported image variable

This ensures that the image is properly processed by Vite's asset handling system during build, which:
- Verifies the image exists at compile time
- Ensures correct path resolution in the built application
- May add content hashing for cache optimization
