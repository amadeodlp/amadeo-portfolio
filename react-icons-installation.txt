# Installation Instructions for react-icons

To complete the implementation of technology icons in the Projects.tsx file, please follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window

2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd D:/amadeo-portfolio
   ```

3. Install the react-icons package:
   ```
   npm install react-icons --save
   ```

4. After the installation completes, start your development server (if not already running):
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Your Projects page should now display technology icons instead of just the first letter of each technology.

## What was changed?

1. Added imports for various icons from react-icons/fa and react-icons/si
2. Created a function called `getTechIcon` that maps technology names to their corresponding icons
3. Updated the technologies section in the Projects page to display the icons
4. Updated the technology tags in project cards to include icons

If you encounter any issues, ensure that:
- The react-icons package installed successfully
- You've refreshed your browser after the changes
- There are no TypeScript errors in your console

The icons are colored to match their official brand colors where possible, enhancing the visual appeal of your portfolio.
