# Portfolio Project Updates

## Changes Made

The following changes have been made to improve the portfolio showcase:

### 1. Cryptara Project (formerly Finance Simplified)
- Renamed from Finance Simplified to Cryptara
- Updated project description
- Added real screenshot image
- Moved to the top of the projects list
- Added "featured" flag

### 2. Amadeo Store Project
- Added real screenshot image (amastore.png)
- Maintained featured status

### 3. Wavecaster Project (formerly Canal Radionov)
- Combined two separate projects (Canal Radionov UI and Canal Radionov API) into a single unified project
- Renamed from "Canal Radionov" to "Wavecaster"
- Created a comprehensive description that emphasizes the full-stack nature
- Added all technologies from both previous projects
- Added real screenshot image (wavecaster.png)
- Set as a featured project
- Changed category from separate "frontend" and "backend" to unified "fullstack"

## Technical Implementation

### Image Handling
- Properly imported images using Vite's asset handling system:
  ```javascript
  import cryptaraImage from '@/assets/images/cryptara.png';
  import amastoreImage from '@/assets/images/amastore.png';
  import wavecasterImage from '@/assets/images/wavecaster.png';
  ```

- Updated the project data to use the imported images
- Created a dynamic image rendering system that displays real screenshots for these three projects while maintaining the default styling for other projects

### Project Organization
- Maintained a strategic ordering of projects:
  1. Cryptara (DeFi platform)
  2. Amadeo Store (E-commerce)
  3. Wavecaster (Radio platform)
  4. Other projects

## Benefits

These changes offer several improvements to the portfolio:

1. **Visual Appeal**: Real screenshots provide a much more engaging and professional appearance compared to the default gradient with initials.

2. **Project Consolidation**: Combining the Canal Radionov projects into a single Wavecaster project creates a more cohesive representation of your full-stack capabilities.

3. **Streamlined Portfolio**: By focusing on fewer, higher-quality project presentations, the portfolio feels more curated and impactful.

4. **Technical Accuracy**: The implementation properly handles image assets according to Vite's best practices, ensuring compatibility with the build process.

## Next Steps

Consider the following improvements for the future:

1. Add more project details, such as development challenges overcome or specific features implemented

2. Enhance project cards with technology icons for all listed technologies, not just the first two

3. Consider adding short demo videos or animated GIFs to showcase project functionality

4. Update GitHub repository links if you rename your repositories to match the new project names
